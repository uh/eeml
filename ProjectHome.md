Extended Environments Markup Language (EEML, http://www.eeml.org/), is a protocol for sharing sensor data between remote responsive environments, both physical and virtual. It can be used to facilitate direct connections between any two environments; it can also be used to facilitate many-to-many connections as implemented by the web service Pachube (http://www.pachube.com/), which enables people to tag and share real time sensor data from objects, devices and spaces around the world.

This code is for the EEML library for Processing (http://www.processing.org/), as outlined here: http://www.eeml.org/library/

To use with Java, until the code has been refactored, you just need to import the relevant classes and jars as outlined here: http://community.pachube.com/?q=node/113#comment-141
